# Code Refactor Starter Code
This week's weekly challenge was too make a website more accessible to the public 
I have changed this code in the following ways
1. changed html elements to better represent semantic elements 
2. restructured the elements to follow a more logical structure independent of styling and positioning
3. added alt attributes to the image elements
4. put the heading attributes in sequential order 
5. added a concise, descriptive title
